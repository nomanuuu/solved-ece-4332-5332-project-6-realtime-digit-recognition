Train a convolutional neural network to recognize the MNIST handwritten digits. You may obtain the training and test sets from <u><a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/</a></u><a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">.</a> Your implementation will be judged on the following criteria.

<ol>

 <li>Successful training and testing of classifier indicating training and test accuracies.</li>

 <li>Live demo presenting capture and detection of handwritten digits.</li>

 <li><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> Live Demo presenting localization and identification of a handwritten digit that has been embedded in another image.</li>

</ol>

This is a group project. No more than three students are to form a group and make a single submission.
